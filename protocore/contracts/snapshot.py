"""The run snapshot's schema: how it states its own version, and who may read it.

A snapshot is written by one process and read by another, and the two are not
guaranteed to be the same build. That gap is the whole problem this module
exists for. A reader that quietly accepts a payload it does not understand does
not fail — it resumes a run with fields missing, latches unset and budgets
refilled, and nothing downstream can tell that apart from a run that legitimately
had none of those things. The failure surfaces much later, as an agent that
repeats work it already did or spends an allowance it already spent.

So the snapshot states its schema version in the payload, and a reader that
cannot recognise that version refuses the snapshot outright. Refusing is the
recoverable outcome: the run stays where it was and an operator sees why.

An older payload is not refused where it can be brought forward instead. An
upcaster chain does that: one registered step per version, each reading the
shape one version below it and filling in what that version introduced. A
version with no step is a refusal — skipping one leaves its fields unset, which
is the same silent half-restore.

Versions are integers, they only go up, and the newest is
:data:`SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION`. A payload with no version field at all is
version 1: version 1 is exactly the shape the field was added on top of, and it
is the shape every store already holds, because the field has never shipped
without a value above it. Reading it as anything else would strand every run
that was paused when the change rolled out — and a paused run is the one case
where refusal is not recoverable, since nothing later will accept the payload
either.

    tool had already asked, and not that more than one call was parked at once,
    because there was only ever room for one id.

    the payload already says: the intent record for the parked call is the one
    place the old build distinguished them. A call held at a gate was marked

    asked. A payload with no intent record at all keeps the historical reading,
    approval, because that is the only wait the field was ever set for on a
    build old enough to have no records.

    Nothing else is invented: the version 5 payload recorded no question text
    and no expiry, so the lifted interrupt has an empty payload and never
    expires, which is the truth about a wait nobody put a deadline on.

    The identity is derived from the call id rather than minted fresh, so
