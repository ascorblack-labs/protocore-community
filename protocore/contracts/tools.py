#: ``ToolContext.metadata`` key carrying a delegation child's position in its
#: concurrently-dispatched batch (0-based, LLM-requested order). Set only on the

#: forwards it onto the child so same-path parent-ledger declarations resolve in

#: ``ToolContext.metadata`` key carrying a stable identity for the whole
#: concurrent fan-out GROUP (shared by every child in one ``asyncio.gather``;
#: distinct across groups and across turns). Paired with
#: :data:`SUBAGENT_DISPATCH_ORDER_METADATA_KEY` so the parent ledger can scope
#: batch-order resolution PER GROUP — a later group's same-path declaration wins
#: over an earlier group's regardless of batch width, matching cross-turn
#: last-writer-wins.

#: handle (a :class:`~protocore.runtime.subagent_budget.SubagentTreePermit`, an
#: in-memory object — not serialized, like the cancel ``asyncio.Event`` on the
#: run state). The parent acquires a tree slot at the dispatch site and stamps
#: the handle here so the host runner can put it on the CHILD's run state as
#: :attr:`~protocore.contracts.run_state.RunScopedState.subagent_tree_permit`;
#: the child engine then release-while-awaits around its OWN nested delegation
#: gather. Absent on serial/single dispatch and on the root leader (which owns no
#: permit) ⇒ the child simply never releases/reacquires a tree slot.

#: the channel between a host and the loop is this list and nothing else.
#:
#: Stated as literals rather than assembled from the constants that name them,
#: because those constants live in the modules that read them and a contract
#: module may not import upward from any of those. The test beside this module
#: pins every such constant against this set, so the two cannot drift.
