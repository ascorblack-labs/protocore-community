"""The per-run state a tool call can reach: one typed object, not a bag of keys.

Every cross-call allowance a run carries — the streaks the dispatcher counts,
the cumulative work ledger the whole run tree draws on, the cancel event, the
locks, the satisfied preconditions — used to live in one untyped dictionary
threaded through ``ToolContext.metadata`` under a single agreed string. Three
independent declarations of that string existed across core and the host, and
nothing checked that a reader spelled a key the way its writer did: a typo
produced a missing allowance, which reads at runtime exactly like a run that
legitimately had none.

This is that state with names. A field that moves is a type error at the reader,
a field that is absent has one spelling, and a host wiring its own slots keeps
them in :attr:`RunScopedState.host` — one opaque compartment, so core never has
to know what a host puts there and a host never has to guess which key core
reads.

Only two things in here outlive the process: the run tree's work ledger and the
capacity of its concurrency budget. :meth:`RunScopedState.to_snapshot` states
exactly those, and :meth:`RunScopedState.apply_snapshot` puts them back — live
objects (an ``asyncio.Event``, a semaphore, a lock) are per-process by nature
and are rebuilt by whoever wires the resumed run, never restored from a payload.
