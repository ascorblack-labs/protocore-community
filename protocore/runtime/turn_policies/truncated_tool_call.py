"""A tool call the model started writing and never finished.

The model opens a call, streams part of its arguments, and then the round
ends with an ordinary stop rather than a length cap. What arrives is a call
whose arguments were salvaged by closing the braces the model never sent —
parseable, and wrong. Dispatching it fails on validation, and the model reads
that as "the tool is broken" rather than as "the arguments were too big",
which is the one thing it needed to learn.

So the call is not dispatched. Each truncated call gets a synthetic error
result that says, in both languages, how much it managed to emit and what
size to chunk to, the transcript keeps that instruction, and the turn is run
again from a rebuilt context. The count is bounded per message, because a
model stuck in a "``{``, stop" loop would otherwise spend the whole run on it,
and a clean round gives the whole count back.

The calls the model DID finish in the same message are still dispatched: the
truncation is one call's problem, and dropping its siblings would throw away
work the model completed. That dispatch is a second entry into the dispatch
path, so it carries the same two guarantees the main one does — no new call
after a stop is observed, and every call a gate holds is parked, not just the
first.
