"""Durable tool intent: the record a run writes BEFORE it calls a tool.

A run that dies between "the tool was called" and "the result was written to
history" leaves a ``tool_use`` block with no ``tool_result``. Without a durable
record of the call, a resumed run cannot tell three very different situations
apart:

* the call never started, because a permission gate parked it for approval;
* the call started and its outcome is genuinely unknown;
* the call started, asked the user a question, and is waiting for the answer.

Guessing costs correctness in the worst direction. Reporting an interrupted
call as a failed one invites the model to repeat it, and a repeated call with a
side effect applies that effect twice. Reporting an approval-parked call as
"outcome unknown" invites the opposite mistake: a call the operator never
approved is described to the model as one that may already have run.

So the record is written before the call and carries an explicit lifecycle:

``RESERVED``
    The call is recorded and nothing has been tried yet: no gate has decided,
    no tool has been touched. A resumed run must neither execute it nor say
    anything about its outcome, because there is no outcome to report.
``PENDING_APPROVAL``
    A gate required approval. Dispatch never began. A resumed run must NOT
    execute the call; it waits for the approval to arrive.
``DISPATCHED``
    The tool was invoked and the result is not yet known. A resumed run must
    NOT repeat the call; it reports the honest unknown outcome instead.
``PAUSED_ASK_USER``
    The tool began executing and asked the user a question. A resumed run must
    neither execute nor declare the outcome unknown; the answer settles it.
``SETTLED``
    A result exists. Nothing to recover; repeats are no-ops.

The state is what a resumed run reads. ``replay`` stays alongside it as the
policy that says whether repeating THIS tool is acceptable at all.
