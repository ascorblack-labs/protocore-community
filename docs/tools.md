# Tool surface

The core deliberately keeps the agent-visible tool list **small and stable**: a
small universal pool keeps the prompt cheap for smaller local models, and a
deterministic ordering keeps the KV-prefix cache reusable across turns. For the
default backend-bound surface (sandbox / exec / read / write) the core registers no
concrete tool — it defines the *shape* and the machinery that runs one tool call
safely, and the host binds the backend-backed implementations. (The core does
ship its own protocol-surface tools — ask-user and memory — see the
[scope note](#tool-surface) above.)

## The `@tool` decorator

`tools/decorator.py` provides a lightweight in-core helper to turn an async
function into a `Tool` subclass. A Pydantic `TypeAdapter` derives the parameter
JSON Schema from the function's type hints; the special `context: ToolContext`
parameter is skipped. The decorated callable is **replaced** with the generated
`Tool` subclass.

`tool`, `ToolContext`, and `ToolResult` are re-exported at the package top
level:

```python
from protocore import tool, ToolContext, ToolResult


@tool(name="echo", description="Echo back the input.")
async def echo(context: ToolContext, text: str) -> ToolResult:
    return ToolResult(tool_call_id="...", content=text)
```

A result carries its canonical value and, beside it, projections for the model
and for the client — see [Extending the Core](./extending.md) where those
fields are worked through with an example.

The wrapped function must be `async` — `@tool` raises `TypeError` otherwise.
`echo` is now a `Tool` subclass whose `.definition` carries `name`,
`description`, and the schema built from the `text: str` hint. The
backend-backed default tools use this decorator but live in
the host package; the core itself registers none of them (though it
does ship the ask-user / memory protocol-surface tools). For richer
or stateful tools, implement the `Tool` ABC (`contracts/tools.py`) directly.

---

## Dispatch pipeline

`runtime/tool_dispatch.py` — `ToolDispatcher.dispatch(...)` is the **single core
entry point** for executing one `ToolCall` after the LLM has finished emitting
it. The dispatcher is agnostic to the tool implementation: it depends only on
`Tool.invoke`. It **never raises** on a tool error — every failure mode is
translated into a `tool_result(success=false)` block so the model can recover on
the next turn and the run never hard-crashes.

`dispatch()` is an async generator that yields `TurnEvent` envelopes and, as its
final item, a `DispatchOutcome`. The lifecycle:

1. **Registry lookup** — `DispatchErrorKind.unknown_tool` if the name is not
   registered.
2. **Schema validation** — the byte-cap / JSON-serialisability invariant on the
   input dict (tool-specific Pydantic validation lives in the host adapter).
3. **Permission gate** — fans out to `ToolPermissionGate.check(...)` (below). A
   `require_approval` verdict surfaces a `tool_call_pending` event and emits no
   tool result; the caller transitions the loop to `AWAITING`.
4. **Preconditions** — the tool's `ToolDefinition.preconditions` DAG is checked
   (below); an unsatisfied tool short-circuits to a failure when
   `LoopConstants.tool_preconditions_enabled` is set.
5. **Execute** — `tool.invoke(ctx)` wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for` honouring
   `rc.tool_timeout_seconds`.
6. **The `post_tool_use` coordinate** — fire-and-await; may rewrite the output.

`DispatchOutcome` (frozen) carries `success`, `content`, `is_error`,
`error_kind`, `approval_required` / `approval_token`, `ask_user_required` /
`ask_user_payload`, `duration_ms`, and a `metadata` bag. `DispatchErrorKind` is
the failure taxonomy: `validation | permission | execution | timeout |
rate_limit | unknown_tool | consecutive_error_cap`. The last is a guard — once
the per-run consecutive-identical-error streak exceeds
`tool_dispatch_consecutive_error_cap`, the dispatcher rewrites the failure into
this kind so a stuck loop terminates instead of burning iterations.

A tool may attach a machine-readable `structured_error` dict (e.g.
`{"finalization_recommended": True, "reason": ...}`) to a raised exception; the
dispatch except-branch forwards it on `DispatchOutcome.metadata` and the loop
surfaces a finalize hint to the model.

See the [Tool dispatch + gating](architecture.md#dispatch-roles-the-canonical-result-and-pairing-repair) section
for the event-emission contract.

## Permission gate

`runtime/tool_permission.py` — `ToolPermissionGate.check(...)` runs an async
pipeline and returns the **first non-allow** `ToolPermissionDecision`. The
decision's `outcome` is one of `allow` / `deny` / `require_approval`, with an
optional rewritten `modified_input` and `approval_token`. Each decision also
records the `PermissionStage` at which it was reached (for telemetry).

The `PermissionStage` StrEnum names the gate's four ordered stages, plus a
no-op default:

| Order | Stage (`PermissionStage`) | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `whitelist` | The `ToolVisibilityPolicy` (and any subagent narrowing whitelist) must permit the tool name — `blocked` always denies, `visible` (when non-empty) is a strict allow-list. |
| 2 | `safety_policy` | Per-side-effect-class checks via the `IToolSafetyPolicy` chain. |
| 3 | `rate_limit` | Host-only; the baseline is a no-op `allow`. Compose a Redis-backed bucket policy via `register_policy` to deny here. |
| 4 | `hook` | The `pre_tool_use` coordinate — the final, highest-leverage stage; it can flip `allow` → `deny` / `require_approval` / modify the args. Skipped when no hook manager is wired. |
| — | `default` | The decision's StrEnum default value, used for the implicit `allow` when no stage objected. |

A safety policy implements `IToolSafetyPolicy` — `applies_to(side_effect_class)`
plus `evaluate(tool, arguments, ctx)`. The default policy stack contains exactly
one policy:

- `ShellSafetyPolicyAdapter` — wraps `DefaultShellSafetyPolicy`, inspecting the
  argument the host declared as the shell command for tools carrying the
  `runs_shell` role. A tool whose command spelling is undeclared is sent for
  approval rather than run unexamined: the check cannot be skipped just because
  the core does not know where to look.

`HttpDnsAllowlistPolicy` and `WorkspacePathPolicy` are provided but **not** in
the default stack; the host stacks them on at runtime via `register_policy`,
which keeps the core API frozen. The gate is always on. The `pre_tool_use`
coordinate is the highest-leverage seam for an LLM-as-policy gate.

See the [Permission gate](architecture.md#dispatch-roles-the-canonical-result-and-pairing-repair) section for the
gate's place in the dispatch flow and the side-effect class map.

## The 3-layer effective surface

`runtime/tool_registry.py` — `ToolRegistry` implements the `IToolRegistry`
contract (`contracts/tool_registry.py`). Its `compute_effective_surface(...)` is
the per-turn filter that keeps the LLM's tool list small and relevant while
preserving a byte-deterministic ordering. It is called by the loop each turn and
applies three layers:

1. **Policy** — apply the `ToolVisibilityPolicy` (`visible` allow-list /
   `blocked` deny-list / `pinned` always-include), yielding the tenant's
   visible set.
2. **Clipping** — if `top_k is None` or the visible set is already `<= top_k`,
   return it sorted by name (no retrieval at all).
3. **Progressive discovery** — otherwise BM25-rank the visible set by the recent
   user `query` (`runtime/tool_retrieval.py`), always include the `pinned`
   tools, and keep the top-K by score.

```python
def compute_effective_surface(
    self,
    tenant_id: str,
    policy: ToolVisibilityPolicy,
    *,
    query: str = "",
    top_k: int | None = None,
) -> Sequence[ToolDefinition]: ...
```

Whichever layer runs, the **final ordering is always name-ascending** — the
retrieval order drives *selection*, but the emitted list is sorted by name so
the LLM context stays byte-stable and the KV-prefix cache survives across turns.
The clip threshold is the RC `tool_retrieval_top_k` passed by the loop.

See the
[Tool retrieval / pool / registry / 3-layer surface](architecture.md#technology-inventory)
section for the retrieval internals.

## Tool preconditions

Preconditions enforce tool **ordering**: a tool that requires a prior
observation is masked until its precondition is satisfied, so the model cannot,
for example, mutate a record before reading the governing policy.

There are two systems; they never interact:

- **Runtime DAG** — `runtime/tool_preconditions.py` (`check_preconditions`,
  `resolve_precondition`, `record_satisfaction`, `compute_masked_tools`,
  `derive_satisfied_from_messages`). A tool's `preconditions` are
  read from its `ToolDefinition`; the satisfied set is replayed from the run's
  own messages, so it survives snapshot/resume without being persisted at all.
  This layer is consumed in
  the dispatch path (step 4 above) and is gated by
  `LoopConstants.tool_preconditions_enabled` (default `False`). It
  **blocks** a tool the model chose.
- **Run-level forcer** — `runtime/run_tool_preconditions.py` plus
  `QueryEngineConfig.tool_preconditions`. An ordered tuple of tools this run
  **must** call before the agent is free to answer; while an entry is
  outstanding the loop sets `LLMRequest.extra['forced_tool_choice']`. Empty
  (the default) is a no-op. This **forces** a tool the model did not choose.

See the [Tool preconditions](architecture.md#technology-inventory)
section for the precondition mechanism.

## What a tool declares: roles, and what its result is

**Roles, not names.** The runtime asks what a call DOES, never what it is
called. `contracts/tool_roles.py` is where that is said: `ToolRole` is the
capability (`reads_path`, `writes_path`, `appends_path`, `edits_path`,
`finalizes_path`, `searches_workspace`, `runs_shell`, `fetches_url`,
`delegates_work`, `records_plan`, `discovers_tools`, `asks_user`,
`never_delegated`), and `ToolRoleMap` — passed in as
`QueryEngineConfig.tool_roles` — is the host's declaration of which of ITS tool
names carry which of them. The map also carries the argument spellings that go
with those roles (`ToolArgumentSlot`): which key holds the shell command, which
holds the body of a write, which holds a terminal tool's answer. The runtime
reads raw arguments before any input model has resolved an alias, so it has to
be told them rather than guess.

Every comparison of a tool name against a string spelled inside the core used to
assume that every installation names its tools the way the first one did. A host
that called its shell tool something else lost the shell deny-patterns, its
large-file writes stopped converging, and nothing anywhere said so — the
comparison simply never matched. A role the map does not mention is now a
capability this installation does not have, and the feature that needs it says
so in a warning rather than going quietly inert.

The same map bounds a delegated run:
`runtime/child_capabilities.py::narrow_child_capabilities` computes what a child
may do from its parent and its `SubagentDef`, narrowing only. It is applied
twice — when the child's catalogue is resolved and again on each of the child's
calls — because the catalogue keeps a child from being shown what it may not
have, and the gate keeps it from having what it was not shown.

**One value, three audiences.** `ToolResult.content` is the canonical value,
complete whatever its size. The projections sit beside it: `model_projection`
is what the transcript carries in its place (the first page of a long listing,
`wrote 4.2 MB to <path>` for bytes the model has no use for reading back);
`ui_payload` rides the result event and never enters the transcript, so a whole
rendered table costs no tokens and cannot change what the model decides;
`canonical_ref` names a blob the whole value can be fetched back from — and when
a tool names none, compaction stores the value itself at the moment it first
needs the room and fills this in on the block it rewrites. A tool that names no
projection says the value is small enough to be its own, which is the common
case and costs it nothing.

**A record before the call.** Every dispatched call commits an `IntentRecord`
(`runtime/intent.py`) before the tool is touched, with its result ids reserved
and an explicit lifecycle — `RESERVED`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `DISPATCHED`,
`PAUSED_ASK_USER`, `SETTLED`. That is what lets a resumed run tell apart a call
that never started, one whose outcome is genuinely unknown, and one that is
waiting on an answer. Guessing costs correctness in the worst direction:
reporting an interrupted call as failed invites the model to repeat it, and a
repeated call with a side effect applies that effect twice.

## Extending the tool surface

- **Add a tool:** implement the `Tool` ABC (`contracts/tools.py`) or use `@tool`;
  register the resulting `ToolDefinition` with the `IToolRegistry`.
- **Control visibility:** set `visible` / `blocked` / `pinned` on a
  `ToolVisibilityPolicy`.
- **Add a safety check:** implement `IToolSafetyPolicy` and register it with
  `ToolPermissionGate.register_policy` — it evaluates after the defaults; the
  core gate stays frozen.
- **Declare what it does:** add the tool's `ToolRole`s and argument slots to the
  `ToolRoleMap` you pass as `QueryEngineConfig.tool_roles`. A tool the map does
  not describe still runs; what it loses is every behaviour that depends on
  knowing what kind of call it is.
- **Gate by observed state:** a rule keyed on an argument pattern plus
  something already observed in the run is a **host** evaluator bound at the
  lifecycle seam, not a core mechanism. The core's two precondition systems are
  the DAG and the run-level forcer above.

See [`extending.md`](extending.md) for the broader "pick your seam" guide and
the import-boundary rule.
