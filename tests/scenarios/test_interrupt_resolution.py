"""End-to-end scenarios for answering everything a run is waiting on.

Every scenario drives the engine only through entry points a host is supposed
to reach for — ``QueryEngine.run``, ``resume`` and the engine's own public
park/inspect methods — and observes only what a host can observe: yielded
``TurnEvent``s, the engine's public state and history, and the snapshot it
writes. No private symbol is touched, which is the point: a caller with
nothing else to hold on to has to be able to park a batch, answer it, and be
told plainly when its answers do not fit what the run is actually waiting for.
