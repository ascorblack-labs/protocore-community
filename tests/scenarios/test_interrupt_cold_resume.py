"""A wait outlives the process that recorded it.

The point of making the wait durable is that the process holding it dies. An
operator decision may take a week; the pod does not. So every guarantee below
is asserted across a snapshot boundary — the run is written out by one engine
and picked up by another, built fresh, sharing nothing but the payload — and
the payload alone has to be enough to say what was being waited for, which
call, and of what kind.

The last scenario here is the one that used to be impossible to state at all:
a payload written under the shape that held one call id comes back as a typed
wait, so a run paused across the change is resumable rather than stranded.
