"""Bringing an older snapshot forward, one version at a time.

A snapshot outlives the build that wrote it. It sits in the host's hot store
while pods are replaced under it, so the payload a resuming process picks up is
routinely one shape behind the code reading it. Refusing every one of those
would mean a rollout strands every run that was mid-turn when it started.

The chain is what makes an older payload readable without making the restore
code carry a memory of every shape the snapshot has ever had: each step reads
one version and produces the next, the restore reads only the newest, and a
version nothing knows how to lift is still a refusal.
